# MealPlanning

This application is being designed and built in my spare time. I understand meal planning can be a great benefit to people in many different ways including financially, individual health, and by saving time preparing a meal plan each week or each month.

My goal is to deliver the capabilities to enter meal information into a user interface and then allow users to have to application create a dynamic meal plan based on their preferences.

## Preferences
Preferences could include the following:

* Weekly (including number of meals per week) vs Monthly
* Diet based meal plan (thinking atkins, paleo, macro based, etc)
* Pantry inventory based meal plans

## User Registration

I am thinking of enabling users to register with their favorite existing applications. I realize at some point there may come a time when I would have to manage a user registration component other than from things like google or facebook.

## Other thoughts

I'm thinking that this will be built in a netflix - oss / spring based architecture with a javascript/angular front end
